Work-in-progress assembler and simulator of the 6502,
written in Ruby.

Originally, I was going to fork Nick Morgan's JS simulation
(github.com/skilldrick/6502js), but I decided to do a
rewrite in Ruby. (He's got a very nice interactive "book"
on 6502 assembly programming.)

Nick's version is a modification of the excellent original,
by Stian Soreng (6502asm.com), so probably the most thanks
for the code goes to him.

I'm using the JS code as reference, but probably most of
the internal structure will be quite different.
